# 🗒️To Do List

A To Do List created in python to help organise my tasks across different categories to ensure I do not fall behind.
To Do Lists are basic projects, so I enhanced mine by creating a frontend GUI using **CSS** and **PySide6/PyQT**, a database to store tasks using **MySQL** and a backend in **python** to handle **CRUD** operations.

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ Allows the creation of new tasks, seperated by what the task is for , and stores them in the database
- 👀 Viewing of tasks in different categories, or all tasks created
- 💬 Updating tasks to keep the information relevent
- ❌ Deletion of tasks
